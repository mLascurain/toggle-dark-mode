```    
<toggle-dark-mode></toggle-dark-mode>
<script src="toggle-dark-node.js"></script>
```

<p> After that create your styles for dark mode and light mode in the dark-mode/light-mode classes </p>

<p> If you want to change the style of the button just comment all the styles in the js file. </p>
